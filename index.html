                Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans wore them. In the 19th
                century, French workers identified themselves by wearing them.
                In the 1950s and 1960s, they gained popularity with actors,

                Make small, targeted changes to your design's styles, which can

                  Element selectors target specific elements on a page and apply
                  styles to them, meaning you’re using the styles simply by
                  using the elements.

                <li>
                  Utility selectors make your CSS more modular and reusable -
                  they keep your CSS code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by
                  avoiding the need to write the same styles repeatedly in
                  different parts of your stylesheet.

                Rene's is built with the theory of relativity in mind - The base
                size is used as a reference point for anything else - The entire
                layout system is applied relatively across everything and
                everywhere.

                Easily create and apply consistent sizes to your design's
                styles. This simple and intuitive syntax is a vital part of what
                makes Rene.css a valuable tool for building custom design
                systems and creating responsive, scalable designs.

                Using the rene.css framework as a starting point for your design
                system can be valuable in creating a cohesive and consistent
                look and feel for your project. It can save you time and effort
                in the initial setup and allow you to focus on customizing and
                extending the framework to meet your specific needs. By
                leveraging the pre-existing code and structure of the framework,
                you can create an efficient and effective design system.

                René distinguishes itself from other modern web frameworks by
                being designed to be lightweight, which results in faster
                performance. This also means René consumes fewer resources,
                which is ideal for slow connections and reducing energy usage on
                both the client and server sides.
